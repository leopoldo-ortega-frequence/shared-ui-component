## Introduction

This will serve as the place to understand the Slides Design System.
The scope of this document is to highlight the rules, implementation, and testing of the new slides development system.

## Motivation

As slides continues to grow, we found that there are some aspects of the current slides development process that are not easy to scale. Actions like creating duplicate slides, creating new F templates, and maintaining design consistency have been an ongoing issue.

This new system will alleviate those points while establishing a system in which new slides and slide components can be quickly built and tested.

## What Are Web Components and Why?

We needed a method of modularizing reusable blocks of code and logic. Due to the limitations of RFP, we cannot use third-party systems like React or Angular.

Web Components are a vanilla JavaScript solution that enables us to achieve the goals of creating components that can be reused throughout the development of slides.

## Widget vs Component

A widget defines a component that can be used by itself, examples include a battery bar widget, a donut chart widget, and a TV/Radio schedule chart widget.

- Widgets can contain other widgets.
- An element is usually a smaller reusable component that cannot be used as a standalone component. An example would be a list item with a custom bullet point. While these get used in multiple widgets, they themselves cannot be used as an independent component.

## Base vs Preset Widgets

A Base widget is a widget that can 

## Design Rules

SDS will place a bigger emphasis on design quality than the current process thanks to StoryBook.

As long as Developers use the Figma assets and generated CSS, the slides and widgets should behave as expected and be aligned with the Figma design files.

Nonetheless, here are some rules to ensure that the development of the widgets captures the designer’s intention:

- All numeric and color values should be tied to a CSS variable.
- We will use Flexbox as the primary spacing system.
  - There isn’t anything wrong with Grid, but the designs and behaviors are built with Flexbox in mind.
- Separation of Slides level styling and Component level styling.
  - Components are meant to be standalone, therefore they will have their own set of styles.
  - If we need to adjust a component style to better fit a slide, it is done at the slide level.
  - Slides (e.g., Overview, Print, Addressable) will have their own set of styles separate from the components.

## Development Rules

### Widgets & Elements

- Widgets should be as dumb as possible. We want to put the decision-making and agency behind designers and developers.
- Widgets should not process data, read-only.
- Only wrapper widgets can map through data to render to child widgets.
- Widgets by default are ‘base’ widgets when created, meaning that they must be usable in different scenarios.
- If a widget needs to be more specific.

### Rules for Slides & Slide Variations

### Misc Rules

- Any deviations from the design when developing to be communicated with the rest of the team. This also includes PDF changes.
